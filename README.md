This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: infinite recursion due to a missing or incomplete base case. The `bug.py` file contains a factorial function that works correctly for non-negative integers but throws a `RecursionError` when given negative input. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles negative inputs gracefully.
